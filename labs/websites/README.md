Creating and Calling a Custom REST API with Azure WebSites
==========================================================

"Azure Websites is a fully managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that enables you to build, deploy and scale enterprise-grade web Apps in seconds. Focus on your application code, and let Azure take care of the infrastructure to scale and securely run it for you."

First you'll create a custom RESTful Web Service using Node.js and host it in Azure WebSites. Next we will connect to and consume that service from your Tessel microcontroller.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to successfully complete this lab you need to:

* Have successfully setup your Azure Subscription, your development environment and your Tessel according to instructions outlined in the [Setup Lab](../_setup).

Instructions
------------

In this lab we will use the new [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com) for all server side activities, including:

* Creating an Azure WebSite
* Writing a simple Node.js RESTful Web Service
* Invoking and debugging your service

Allthough we do this from within the Azure Portal there are plenty of other ways you can achieve the same thing, for example: create the website using Azure-CLI (Azure x-plat) or deploy custom code using Git. Have a look at the section about additional references at the end of this lab for more information.

### Creating a new Azure Website

* Start by logging in to the [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com).

![Portal Screenshot](images/portal.png)

_Since this portal is higly customizable and also evolves at a high pace, chances are that it might not look exactly the same as on the above picture, but the basics should be the same"_

* Press the "+ NEW" button, located in the lower left corner and select Website from the list.
* Fill in the URL to your new Website and press the "Create" button when you are done. (Feel free to change whatever other options you want to change. Perhaps you want the datacenter location to be different?)

After a short while, you'll get a notification that your website is all setup and ready for you to deploy code to.

* Familiarize yourself with the information in the dashboard for the website you just created. From here you can manage scaling, monitoring, deployments, etc. so you will use this portal from time to time.
* While looking at the portal for your website, find the section called "Configuration" and "press the tile "Extensions"

![Site Extensions Screenshot](images/site-extensions.png)

That will bring out a new panel where you can see any "site extensions" installed. In order to create our Node.js web service we are going to use a Site Extension called Visual Studio Online (code name Monaco) to create and edit code directly from the portal. _Remember, this is just one way of doing it and perhaps not the way you choose to do this later or when running a service in production._

* Click "+ Add" to add a new "Site Extension" to your website
* Select Visual Studio Online" as the extension to add
* Read and accept the legal terms"
* Press the "OK" button when you are done

_You've just installed a Site Extension to your Azure Website from a gallery of allready existing extensions. If you want you can create and install custom site extensions to extend the functionality of your websites._

Now that you have the Visual Studio Site Extension installed, it's time to use it to write some code.

* Click on the "Visual Studio Online" site extension
* Click "Browse" button" at the top of the new panel that just opened

A new browser window or tab will open running Visual Studio Online on top of your Azure Website. You are automatically signed in as administrator, other users will have to logon in order to access these features.

_The site extension "Visual Studio Online" allows you to create and edit content online only using a web browser. It's like your normal IDE hosted on top of your Website. On the left side you'll find a couple of command buttons that help you invoke different features. The top most button lets us explore our website and as you can see there is allready a file created for us, "hostingstart.html"._

### Writing the server side code

During this lab, we will develop a simple RESTful API that returns a random number between 1 and 6 when it get's a request. Even though we could do this using any supported programming language, we will use JavaScript/Node.js in order to have a similar experience as when developing for the Tessel.

Let's implement the service!

* Remove the file "hostingstart.html" by right clicking on it and selecting delete.
* Add a new file by clicking the "New File Icon" in the "Explorer Section" and name the file server.js

_As soon as you have selected a file, you can imediately start editing that file._

**WARNING! Visual Studio Online will automatically save your files and since you currently are editing the live version of our Website, your changes will be active imediately. This lab focuses on the collaboration between the Tessel device and Azure and does not provide guidance around how to best handle real life Application Lifecycle Management. There are many guides and whitepapers that cover this and Azure Website is very well equiped to handle those scenarios**

* Copy and paste the code from [api/server.js](api/server.js) into your newly created file in Visual Studio Online. Visual Studio Online will save your changes automatically so you don't have to save your file.

You should see something like the below image

![server.js in Visual Studio Online](images/serverjs-visual-studio-online.png)

* Press the "Run" button on the left side of the window

_Visual Studio Online and Azure Web Site discover that we are about to start a Node.js application. Azure Websites runs on top of Internet Information Server, IIS, and in order to host a Node.js application we need to configure iisnode. This is done automatically for us by adding and configuring the web.config file that you'll see in the Explorer window later on._

You'll be redirected to your website and if everything works correctly you'll be greeted with a JSON document, containing a random number between 1 and 6.

* Refresh the browser to invoke the service multiple times and watch how the random number changes.
* Go back to Visual Studio Online and see how an output window has opened next to your code. Look at how logs get written everytime you invoke your service.

Congratulations, you have now created, hosted and invoked a custom Web Service using Node.js and Azure Websites.

### Connecting Tessel to our Custom API in mobile services

Let's now call the custom RESTful Web API from our Tessel. The sample code is located in the [tessel](tessel) folder. Examine the code and change the URL to point to your custom API. Run the code:

	cd tessel
	tessel run blinky-websites.js

You will see some output on the console, press the config-button (close to the orange led on your Tessel) and your Tessel will call your custom API hosted on Azure Websites. When the random number returns, the Tessel will flash its led as many times as the random number.

### Monitor server side log using Azure-CLI (Azure x-plat tools)

Each time you press the button on the Tessel a HTTP Request is sent to the Azure Website hosting your "random service". Wouldn't it be nice if you could monitor whatever gets written to the serverside log, directly from your computer? It turns out it is quite easy.

In the [setup lab](../_setup) you connected your Azure subscription with the current user on the computer, now you can use the command line tools for azure to monitor the server log. Keep the Tessel blinky-websites application running and open a new terminal/console window, execute the following command in the new window. Replace [websitename] with the name of the website you created.

	azure site log tail [websitename]

As you keep sending requests to your web service, you'll see how the logs displays in real time on your computer. Very for debugging and simple monitoring.

### Extra Workout

* Update your RESTful API using the portal so the service never returns the number 3 (or any number you select)
* Call out to any other service, in Azure our outside, from within your custom API code
* Update your server side code so that you have a dependency for other NPM packages, for example 'express' by adding a correctly written packet.json file. _(Hint: in order to download and install the external dependencies, use the "Console" inside Visual Studio Online to execute the command "npm install")_
* Create a new website and deploy your server side code using Git instead of using Visual Studio Online, then connect your tessel to that site and verify that it works ([more info](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-deploy/))
* Setup continious deployment from [visualstudio.com](http://visualstudio.com) or [github.com](http://github.com) and verify that you can deploy code just by "checking in" or pushing.
* Develop your RESTful service using any other supported programming language, i.e: .NET, PHP, Java, Python, Node.js ([more info](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/websites/))

Summary
-------
You have:

* Created an Azure Website
* Created a Node.JS RESTful API service with Visual Studio Online and deployed it on Azure Websites
* Created a program that calls this Node.JS service and makes the Tessel Microcontroller led blink
* Deployed the program on your Tessel Microcontroller and ran it

__Go ahead and play with the solution. Tweak it, extend it, use it in a bigger context. Have fun!__
